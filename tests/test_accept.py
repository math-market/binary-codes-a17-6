"""Prove the checker's ACCEPT path works.

Every other test in CI asserts that something is rejected. A checker that
rejected everything unconditionally would pass all of them and be worthless, so
this exercises the one branch they cannot reach: it loads the checker, lowers
only the winning threshold, and feeds it a submission that is valid but does not
beat the real bar. That submission must now be accepted with exit code 0.

Nothing here is used in judging — the shipped checker has no threshold knob, by
design. This is a unit test of the branch, not a configuration option.
